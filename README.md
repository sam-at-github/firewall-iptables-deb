firewall-iptables-deb
=====================

Simple iptables firewall with port forwarding, setup as a inserv init script.
Mostly copied from David A. Ranch (http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch). Rewritten here as an debian Linux init script.
You'll probably have to edit port list, and interface names in this file.
Use firewall-checkmodules to check you have the required kernel modules available.
